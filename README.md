## ‚ú® Features
- **Product Management**: Add new products with details like name, image, price, initial stock, and tags.  
- **Dynamic Inventory**: The inventory list displays all products, their current stock, and their price.

- **Shopping Cart**: A fully functional cart where users can add products, adjust quantities, and remove items.
